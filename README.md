# RIDE : Haskell for Entreprise

:warning: This is WIP. 
Please, __don't post anything on reddit for now__.

`Ride` aim to provide project teams all of the necessary tools for happy haskell hacking. It build on other components like [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) or [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)

### Components

 1. `haskell-web-ide` : A full feature collaborative web-based haskell IDE, fast, complete, but opinionated ([features](/haskell-web-ide#haskell-web-ide))
 2. `jetpack-gen` : A tool generating large and complete prelude alternatives, with all possible functions possibly needed in your project. (names are prefixed to avoid name clashes.)
 3. `jetpack` : An example prelude with batteries included, suitable for most projects. Never bother with imports and package anymore
 4. `web playground` : A simple webframework
 5. `chrotomate` : A simple chrome automation library
